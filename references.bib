%Created the HeRO algorithm which uses defeasible logic to create a minimal theory. This creates a default class and some rules,  (basically AR) and uses it on the BC dataset. Performance is similar to my AR results on the dataset.

%Uses an argument version of the CN algorithm (decision rules) on the BC dataset. Arguments are based on domain knowledge, so useless for this situation. It compares HerO with the CN and the original BC nn!
